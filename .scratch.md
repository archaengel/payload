We want to have comments
Attached to RTF
Anchored to spec indices
Threading ?
We don't have persisting comment on changes

## Thoughts
Comment collection?
 - we store the id of the content
 - start and end index of anchor
 - content of comment
 - name of the field (this wouldn't be scalable)

Comments as linked content
 - defining comment as separate content, and link to article or page
 - links to list of comments

Comments part of an existing content
- defining comment data model within content (ie article or page)
- defining a wrapper to contain a list of comments.

- simliar to workflow, allow enabling comments for a content type
- commenting will be auto-attached for any RTF within the content
